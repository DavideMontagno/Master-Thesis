## Overview

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization problem that aims at determining the placement of VNF chains by taking into account the limited resources on board of UAVs, including energy, and that aims at maximizing the UAVs operational lifetime.

## Prerequisite

1. IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.10.0
2. https://scikit-mobility.github.io/scikit-mobility/

To use the project, follow these steps:

To use the `compute_grid.ipynb` notebook, you need to provide an input dataset with the same features as the [Beijing-Trajectories-Project](https://github.com/jbremz/Beijing-Trajectories-Project) dataset. Place the downloaded dataset file in the `dataset` directory.

## Computing Request Dataset

Once you have the input dataset, you can proceed to compute the set of requests (R) to be fed as input to our model. This step can be achieved by executing the `compute_R.ipynb` notebook.

## Input Dataset Generation

Alternatively, if you don't have access to the Beijing Trajectories dataset or want to generate datset starting from data got from the previous step, you can use the `syn_data.ipynb` notebook. 


To get the results:

1. Change the parameters of the network (base station and drones) in the `conf_project.yaml` file.

2. Execute the model by either running `main.ipynb` as a single run with a predetermined number of drones, or by executing a brute force method to find the minimum number of drones where the solution is still feasible.

3. Obtain the visual results by running `parse_table.ipynb`.
